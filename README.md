### Problem Statement: Shopping Cart Application
#### Overview
Build a simple Shopping Cart application that allows users to create and manage shopping carts, add items to carts, view the contents of
their cart. The application should have a RESTful API for the backend, a database to store the data. The solution should be
production-ready with proper tests, error handling, logging and documentation.
#### Requirements

**User requirements**:
1. Users should be able to add an item to the cart.
2. Users should be able to update the quantity of an item in the cart.
3. Users should be able to remove items from the cart.
4. Users should be able to view the price of items that are in the cart.
5. Users should be able to use the same shopping cart until it's checked out.
6. User should be able to view the Cart Total.
Implement server-side logic to calculate the total price for each cart. A cart will consist of multiple line items & each item
will have a unit price & quantity associated with. Calculate the item totals & cart totals.
Ensure proper error handling and input validation.
**Design Requirements**:
Design a database schema to support the ShoppingCart use cases.
Design the RESTful APIs to support the User Requirements mentioned above.
**Testing**:
Write unit tests and integration tests for the backend.
**Production Readiness**:
Ensure the code is well-structured, following best practices.
Provide a script or instructions for setting up the development environment and deploying the application.
**Documentation and Deployment**:

Document the API using a tool like Swagger or API Blueprint.
Provide clear setup instructions, including environment variables, database setup, and how to run tests.
Include a Dockerfile and/or deployment scripts for ease of deployment.

#### Evaluation Criteria

**Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and well-documented code.
**Functionality**: Meets all the specified requirements.
**Testing**: Comprehensive tests for backend logic.
**Design**: Efficient database schema and API design.
**Production Readiness**: Proper error handling, input validation, logging and documentation.

#### Submission
Provide a GitHub repository link with the complete source code, along with a README file that includes setup instructions, API
documentation, and any other relevant information.
